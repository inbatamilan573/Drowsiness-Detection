# Drowsiness-Detection
 Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for real-time detection of drowsiness based on eye state (open or closed). The project addresses the crucial need for enhanced driver safety by identifying signs of fatigue during driving. 

 ### Key Features
- Trained the model on a dataset of open and closed-eye images, achieving 88% accuracy.
- Utilized data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Developed a real-time drowsiness detection application using OpenCV for practical deployment.
- Evaluated model performance with a confusion matrix and ROC curve for comprehensive analysis.
- Visualized project results through Matplotlib for effective communication.
